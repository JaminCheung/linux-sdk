 * Fingerprint errors are meant to tell the framework to terminate the current operation and ask
 * for the user to correct the situation. These will almost always result in messaging and user
 * interaction to correct the problem.
 *
 * For example, FINGERPRINT_ERROR_CANCELED should follow any acquisition message that results in
 * a situation where the current operation can't continue without user interaction. For example,
 * if the sensor is dirty during enrollment and no further enrollment progress can be made,
 * send FINGERPRINT_ACQUIRED_IMAGER_DIRTY followed by FINGERPRINT_ERROR_CANCELED.
